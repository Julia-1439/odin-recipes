# odin-recipes
This project is a basic website containing recipes. It consists of a homepage linking to various recipes I enjoy! 

Skills I use include: HTML boilerplate, Text elements, Lists, Links, Images, and Writing git commit messages. 

For the future, I should consider using SVG image files. This was overall a very fun first project where I got the opportunity to utilize all the HTML skills I've learned. :)
