	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		The <strong>peanut butter and jelly sandwich</strong> is a staple American food. It is often eaten as a snack or a light meal. The choice of bread, peanut butter, and jam make for many varieties to eat them in to keep it interesting! I personally enjoy using wheat bread for a fiber boost, light jam to keep the sugar low, and to eat it as a snack any time of day.
